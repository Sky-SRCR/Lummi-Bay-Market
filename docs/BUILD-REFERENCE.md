# Build Reference — Multi-Display

> **Read this file after finishing each module, before starting the next one.**
> It is the standing contract for the whole multi-display build

Vocabulary is fixed in [`../CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md): **Display**, **Viewer**,
**Screen**, **screen name tag**, **canvas**, **grant**, **edit lock**. Use those
words in code, comments, commits, and UI copy. Never `slug`, `kiosk page`,
`monitor`, `artboard`, `checkout`.

## 1. Architecture: deep modules

The app was a flat set of page scripts where every page talked to the database
directly. Multi-display support adds one invariant that must hold in *every*
query — *this row belongs to that Display* — and a scattered version of that rule
is how you empty every sign at once. So the display-scoped data access lives
behind a small number of **deep modules** in `lib/`, and the page scripts
(`api.php`, `viewer.php`, `builder.php`, `admin_panel.php`) become **thin
adapters** over them.

Design rules, applied to every module added by this build:

- **Small interface, large implementation.** Callers say *what* they want
  (`publish this layout to this Display as this account`), never *how*
  (transactions, temp-id maps, staleness comparison, sanitising, scoping).
- **The invariant lives inside, once.** No caller may construct SQL that touches
  `canvas_elements` or `displays`. If a caller needs a new query, the module gets
  a new method — the caller does not get a `$pdo`. That holds between the modules
  too: `LayoutStore` owns `canvas_elements` and takes a `DisplayStore` to reach
  the stamp, the background and the publish record, rather than writing to
  `displays` itself.
- **Deletion test.** If deleting the module would make complexity reappear in
  several callers, it earns its keep. If it would just vanish, it was a
  pass-through and should be inlined.
- **The interface is the test surface.** Anything worth testing is reachable
  through the module's public methods. Pure logic that deserves a unit test is
  factored into an internal, private-by-convention helper (an *internal seam*)
  rather than exposed on the interface.
- **No new seam without two adapters.** There is one database and one HTTP
  surface; don't add interfaces for imagined swapability.
- **Errors are values, not strings.** A module returns a result object naming the
  outcome (`ok` / `stale` / `failed`); the adapter turns it into JSON and copy.
  Adapters must never re-derive an outcome from a message string.

### Module map (`lib/`)

| Module | Interface, in one line | Hides |
|--------|------------------------|-------|
| `schema.php` | `ensureSignageSchema(PDO): void` | Every idempotent `ALTER`/`CREATE`, the `displays` table, `display_id` + backfill + index + FK, the drive-thru seed, and the "run at most once per request" latch. |
| `displays.php` | `Display` + `Background` value objects, `DisplayStore` | **Every** `displays` statement: tag rules and suggestion, canvas bounds, background intents, the publish stamp and record, the lock columns, and self-healing when the table is not there yet. |
| `grants.php` | `GrantStore`, `Actor` | **Every** `display_permissions` statement, and the whole of "may this account have that Display?" — the two axes of ADR-0005 combined in one predicate, `Actor::mayOpen()`, that the seam and the picker both ask. |
| `display_admin.php` | `DisplayAdmin(PDO, DisplayStore, LayoutStore, GrantStore)` → `DisplayResult` | Administering a Display: what a complete one needs, creating it blank or as a duplicate of one the same shape, renaming, retiring, destroying it with its layout and its grants, and setting the whole access matrix — each all-or-nothing. Writes no SQL of its own; holds the transaction that spans the three stores. |
| `layout_store.php` | `LayoutStore(PDO, DisplayStore)` | The publish transaction end to end: staleness check, wipe-and-reinsert scoped to one Display, temp-id mapping, asset auto-save, plain-text stripping, admin/basic section rules, element index, scoped hide/delete. |
| `plain_text.php` | `toPlainText(string): string` | ADR-0002's sanitising, in a file with no session side effects so the store can include it. |
| `display_request.php` | `DisplayRequest::forViewing/forEditing(...)` → `DisplayResolution` | Which Display an HTTP request means and whether the account asking may have it, the ADR-0003 notice wording per failure case, and the editing entry rule. The one place grants are enforced. |

`lib/` is denied to the browser by `lib/.htaccess`. Nothing in `lib/` prints,
redirects, reads `$_POST`/`$_GET`, or touches `$_SESSION` — adapters pass what
the module needs as arguments. That is what keeps them testable without a web
server.

### Where later phases attach

Adding a phase should mean *filling in a module*, not threading a new concept
through the app again:

- ~~**Phase 2** (canvas dimensions)~~ **Done.** `viewer.php` and `builder.php` are
  adapters over `DisplayRequest` + `Display`; no `1920`/`1080` literal remains in
  either. No new module was needed. See §7 for the zoom mechanics.
- ~~**Phase 3** (admin Displays screen)~~ **Done**, with one planned shape
  changed — see §4c. The write surface landed as `DisplayStore` (statements and
  table rules) plus a new `DisplayAdmin` (the use case), rather than all of it on
  `DisplayStore`: `duplicateLayoutFrom()` there would have meant `DisplayStore`
  writing `canvas_elements`, which invariant 1 forbids. Both things Phase 2 left
  are settled: `get_editor_layout` is the authenticated editing read, and the
  Builder's picker is in place.
- ~~**Phase 4** (grants)~~ **Done**, with one planned shape changed — see §4d. The
  grant check landed in `DisplayRequest::forEditing()` as planned, so every
  endpoint is covered by construction and none has its own `if`. The picker filter
  did *not* land as `DisplayStore::editableBy()`: it is `Actor::openable()`, next
  to the grants it consults, rather than in the module that owns `displays`.
- **Phase 5** (edit lock): the lock columns already exist on `displays`;
  `DisplayStore` gains `takeLock()`, `heartbeat()`, `releaseLock()`,
  `forceUnlock()`, and `Display::lockState()` decides lapsed-vs-held by comparing
  timestamps on read (no cron). `LayoutStore::publish()` already refuses on a
  stale stamp; it also refuses when the lock moved on.
- **Phase 6** (docs/schema): `schema.sql` is regenerated to match `schema.php`.
  Keep the two in step as you go so Phase 6 is proofreading, not archaeology.

## 2. Invariants — must hold after every phase

1. **Every read and write of `canvas_elements` is Display-scoped.** No statement
   anywhere may touch the table without a `display_id` predicate. The publish
   `DELETE` is the dangerous one: it deletes *this Display's* rows only. Grep
   `canvas_elements` after any change; every hit must be inside
   `lib/layout_store.php`.
2. **No `WHERE id = 1`, ever again.** `canvas_settings` is retired: the table is
   left on the server as a rollback artefact but no code reads or writes it. A
   Display's background lives on the Display row.
3. **A Viewer URL names its Display** (ADR-0003). No default, no master, no
   fallback Display on the viewing path, ever. The one place a request may name no
   Display is the *editing* entry rule in §3, which resolves only when the
   installation has exactly one Display.
4. **Canvas dimensions are immutable after creation** (ADR-0004). Nothing may
   offer, accept, or infer a resize. Duplication is offered only between Displays
   of identical dimensions.
5. **A publish that would overwrite someone else's work is refused, not merged**
   (ADR-0006). There is no undo; refusal is the whole safety net.
6. **Text-block content is plain text** (ADR-0002). `toPlainText()` on save for
   `type = 'text'` only; render with `textContent`. Never `innerHTML`, never
   strip carousel/table/marquee JSON or media paths.
7. **The public path runs no DDL.** `get_layout` is polled every 30s by every
   Screen forever. Schema convergence happens on authenticated requests, plus one
   self-healing retry if the schema is genuinely absent (§3).
8. **Grants and roles are two axes** (ADR-0005). Grants say *which* Displays;
   `users.role` still says *how much* power. Enforcement is server-side, in the
   resolution seam, on reads and writes alike — never by an endpoint's own `if`,
   and never by a Display merely being absent from the picker. Every statement
   against `display_permissions` is inside `lib/grants.php`; every question about
   whether an account may have a Display is one call to `Actor::mayOpen()`.
9. **One filename for the Viewer.** `viewer.php` stays a single file — the
   `<Files "viewer.php">` block in `.htaccess` drops `X-Frame-Options` for the
   SmartSign2Go embed and the kiosk scroll lock rides on it. Renaming or
   splitting it breaks the live sign.
10. **The live database is behind the repo.** Assume nothing about what columns
    exist. Every schema change is an idempotent statement in `schema.php`.

---

## 3. Which Display does a request with no tag mean?

**Viewing: none.** `DisplayRequest::forViewing()` is strict — a Viewer URL names
its Display or renders a notice (ADR-0003), even when a single Display exists and
the guess would have been right. A truncated URL can never silently show another
sign. This became strict in Phase 2, when the Screens started sending their tag.

**Editing: the one Display this account may open, if there is exactly one.** Nobody
with a single sign to work on should be asked which sign they meant, so a Builder
or API request naming no Display resolves to `Actor::openable()` when that list has
one member. At a single-sign store that is the only Display there is; for a `basic`
account holding one grant it is the sign they were given. It is a decided rule, not
a leftover: the roadmap's *Builder entry* decision is "one Display → straight in;
more than one → pick".

The safety property is that this resolves to nothing the moment two Displays are
openable. A write is never routed to a guessed sign — the request fails, and the
Builder shows its picker. It is implemented in exactly one place,
`DisplayRequest::locate()`, which distinguishes viewing from editing by whether it
was handed an `Actor` at all.

Phase 3 removed the *transitional* part: with a picker in place, failing to resolve
is no longer a dead end. Phase 4 generalised the rule from "the installation's only
Display" to "this account's only Display" — the same sentence, once an account can
hold fewer Displays than exist.

A `basic` account with more than one grant returns to whatever it last opened
instead of picking again. That lives in `builder.php`, not here: it reads
`$_SESSION`, and nothing in `lib/` may. It is a *preference*, never a permission —
the remembered tag is resolved through `forEditing()` like any other, so a Display
since retired, deleted or un-granted simply falls back to the picker.

---

## 4. Decisions taken during Phase 1

Recorded here rather than as ADRs — they are implementation-level choices inside
decisions already made, not new decisions.

- **The layout stamp is a revision counter, not a timestamp.**
  `displays.layout_revision` increments on every publish; the Builder holds it and
  submits it back. ADR-0006 describes the stamp as "when the layout was last
  published"; a counter implements the same rule without the one-second collision
  window two `DATETIME` publishes would share. `last_published_at` /
  `last_published_by` are still recorded — they are what the Phase 3 admin list
  shows and what the refusal message names.
- **A publish carrying no stamp is refused.** An old tab loaded before this
  deploy holds a pre-Phase-1 layout, which is exactly the write the check exists
  to stop. The refusal names the fix ("reload"), and no publish path in the
  shipped code omits the stamp.
- **Publish takes a row lock on the Display** (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`) inside the
  transaction, so two simultaneous publishes serialise instead of both reading
  the same revision and both passing the check.
- **`canvas_settings` is kept on the server, unread.** Dropping a table on a
  live database with no backup buys nothing; leaving it costs nothing and is a
  rollback path during the one visit where it matters. `schema.sql` documents it
  as retired in Phase 6.
- **PHP 7.1-compatible syntax.** The live server's PHP version is unverified and
  `.htaccess` still carries `mod_php7` blocks, so no typed properties,
  constructor promotion, enums, `readonly`, `match`, or arrow functions. This
  container has PHP 8.4 for `php -l` only.
- **An inactive Display returns no elements from `get_layout`.** The API reports
  `status: "inactive"` and the Phase 2 Viewer renders the notice. A Phase 1
  Viewer would show an empty canvas — unreachable in practice, since nothing can
  deactivate a Display before the Phase 3 UI exists.

---

## 4b. Decisions taken during Phase 2

- **The canvas is CSS-scaled, and every screen-pixel measurement divides by
  `ZOOM`.** `interact.js` reports drag and resize deltas in screen pixels, so a
  scaled canvas desynchronises editing unless each conversion is divided:
  `handleMove` (`event.dx/dy`), `handleResize` (`event.deltaRect` *and*
  `event.rect`, since the new width is a measurement too), and
  `getCanvasDropCenter` (frame scroll geometry). Those three are the complete list;
  a fourth conversion added later must divide as well or dragging will drift at any
  zoom but 100%.
- **`#canvas-sizer` wraps the canvas.** A CSS transform does not change layout
  size, so without a wrapper carrying the *scaled* footprint the editor frame
  cannot scroll to the far edge of a zoomed-in canvas.
- **Zoom-to-fit never magnifies past 100%.** Fitting a small canvas by blowing it
  up would misrepresent how it will look on the Screen.
- **Known caveat:** the section minimum size (`restrictSize`, 100×60) is in screen
  pixels, so at 50% zoom the effective floor is 200×120 canvas pixels. A floor, not
  a correctness problem — left alone rather than adding a fourth zoom conversion.
- **The Viewer resolves server-side.** The canvas is correct on first paint and the
  notice needs no round-trip. It also means `viewer.php` includes no `auth.php` —
  the public path starts no session and runs no DDL.
- **A Display turned off mid-run flips to the notice within one poll.** The Viewer
  treats any non-`success` status as a notice, so deactivating or deleting a
  Display reaches the Screen in ≤30s rather than leaving a stale layout up.
- **The transitional `settings` alias is gone.** Both clients read `display` now,
  and the self-test asserts the alias is absent so it cannot come back.

## 4c. Decisions taken during Phase 3

- **`DisplayAdmin` exists because administering a Display spans both tables.**
  This file planned `duplicateLayoutFrom()` on `DisplayStore`; that would have put
  `canvas_elements` statements in the module that owns `displays`, contradicting
  invariant 1 — the project's central safety property. Resolved by splitting on
  *table* versus *use case*: `DisplayStore` keeps the statements and the table's
  own rules (tag format, tag uniqueness, canvas bounds), and `DisplayAdmin`
  composes the two stores with the validation and the transaction. It holds a PDO
  for `beginTransaction`/`commit` only and writes no SQL — the invariant grep in §5
  is what keeps that honest.
- **Deleting a Display deletes its elements explicitly**, rather than trusting the
  `ON DELETE CASCADE`. The constraint is added by `schemaTry()`, which swallows
  failures, so on a live database behind the repo it may never have applied. A
  Display row deleted without its elements leaves rows no scoped query can ever
  see again.
- **Duplication refuses a non-empty target.** It is a fill, not a merge. Combined
  with the identical-dimensions rule (ADR-0004), the only thing `copyLayout()` can
  do is populate a Display that was created a moment ago.
- **The panel edits background *colour* only.** Images are uploaded from the
  Builder, where the validated upload path already exists and you can see the
  canvas you are changing. Adding a third copy of the upload whitelist to
  `admin_panel.php` (which already has its own, for the logo) was the alternative.
- **A background change from the panel advances the layout stamp.** The background
  is part of what the Screen shows, and an admin with the Builder open would
  otherwise publish their stale colour straight back over it. They get ADR-0006's
  refusal instead.
- **`get_editor_layout` is a separate endpoint, not a flag on `get_layout`.** The
  Viewer's read is public and strict; the Builder's requires a session and accepts
  a deactivated Display. A boolean on one endpoint would have meant the public
  path carrying an authenticated branch.
- **A retired Display is editable by admins only**, which is what CONTEXT.md has
  always said and what the code did not do. `forEditing()` now uses the `$actor`
  argument that had been sitting unused: a `basic` account naming a deactivated
  Display gets the same INACTIVE resolution a Screen would, and the picker does not
  list Displays that account could not open. One check, in the seam — the first use
  of the mechanism Phase 4's grants will extend.
- **The Builder's picker is shown to every account.** The roadmap's *Builder entry*
  decision has `basic` accounts resuming their last Display instead of picking;
  that arrives with grants in Phase 4, because until grants exist every account can
  see every Display and "their last" would be a memory of an unrestricted set.
- **Canvas dimensions have no update statement anywhere.** The way not to offer a
  resize (ADR-0004) is for no method to be able to perform one:
  `DisplayStore::updateDetails()` writes tag, title and location, and that is all.

## 4d. Decisions taken during Phase 4

- **The check lives in the seam, not in `api.php`.** ADR-0005 says enforcement is
  "server-side in `api.php`", which was written before Phase 1 turned that file into
  a thin adapter. The decision it was making — server-side, not merely absent from
  the picker — is honoured more completely here: one check in
  `DisplayRequest::forEditing()` covers all five Display-scoped endpoints and every
  endpoint added later. The ADR is left as written; this is where its address
  changed to.
- **The grant check is one predicate, and the wording is downstream of it.**
  `forEditing()` decides with `Actor::mayOpen()` and only *then* asks the narrower
  question — "is it theirs at all?" — to choose between "turned off" and "not
  assigned to you". A refusal therefore cannot disagree with the decision that
  produced it, which two parallel `if`s would eventually manage.
- **`Actor` carries the account's grants; `DisplayStore` never learns they exist.**
  This file planned `DisplayStore::editableBy(account)` for the picker. That would
  have made the module that owns `displays` depend on the module that owns
  `display_permissions`, to answer a question that is not about the table at all.
  The filter is `Actor::openable(array $displays)` instead — the authority lives
  with the thing that has it, and the picker and the entry rule are then provably
  the same list.
- **`DisplayStore::sole()` is gone.** The entry rule is no longer a fact about the
  table ("is there exactly one row?") but about the account ("is there exactly one
  I may open?"), so the method had nothing left to answer. What remains of it is one
  `count() === 1` in `DisplayRequest::locate()`.
- **A refusal names the sign rather than hiding it.** FORBIDDEN says "That display
  has not been assigned to you", which admits the Display exists. Returning UNKNOWN
  would leak less and help nobody: a clerk who typed a real address would go hunting
  for a typo instead of asking an admin. The Displays a `basic` account is *offered*
  still contain only their own.
- **Grants are read once per request, and only for `basic` accounts.** An admin
  holds every Display by role (ADR-0005), so `Actor::signedIn()` does not even
  query. The public `get_layout` path builds no `Actor` at all — it has no account,
  and a grant read on the poll every Screen makes every 30s would be a query per
  poll against a table the viewing path has no business in.
- **A failed grant read grants nothing.** `GrantStore::pairs()` swallows a database
  failure and returns no grants, so the failure mode is a `basic` account locked out
  (a support call) rather than one let in (a silent hole). The table is created by
  the same convergence every authenticated request runs, so this is a genuinely
  broken database, not a first-run condition.
- **Deleting a Display or an account deletes the grants explicitly**, for the same
  reason Phase 3 deletes elements explicitly: both `ON DELETE CASCADE` constraints
  are added by `schemaTry()`, which swallows failures. An orphaned grant is worse
  than an orphaned element — it is one id reuse away from granting a sign nobody
  assigned.
- **The matrix is one save, covering only the accounts it rendered.** A tick is a
  grant; the whole submitted matrix is applied in one transaction, so what an admin
  sees on screen is what ends up stored. Accounts *absent* from the submission keep
  their grants, so a form left open while someone was added cannot strip the new
  account. Ids naming a deleted Display are dropped rather than refused — the only
  way to send one is a stale form, and there is nothing to save by making an admin
  retype the matrix.
- **Only `basic` accounts are offered grants.** `DisplayAdmin` cannot enforce that:
  roles live on `users`, which is not its table. The panel intersects the submitted
  accounts with the `basic` ones it queried, which both keeps admins out of the
  matrix and stops a forged POST writing grant rows for one.
- **"Basic users resume their last Display" is a session, not a column.** The
  roadmap's entry decision is honoured for the working session: the Builder
  remembers the tag in `$_SESSION` and re-resolves it. A durable version would mean
  a new column on `users` and a stored preference that goes stale the moment a grant
  is revoked, for a store where a `basic` account holding two signs is already the
  unusual case. Signing in afresh shows the picker once.

## 5. Verification

No CI, no test suite, no PHP runtime on the target — verification is deliberate
and manual. Run all of it before every push.

```
php -l <every touched .php>              # syntax; also a GitHub Action
php tools/selftest_layout.php            # the real modules, in-memory database
grep -rn "canvas_elements" --include=*.php .   # only lib/layout_store.php may hit
grep -rn "INTO displays\|UPDATE displays\|FROM displays" --include=*.php .  # only lib/, plus tools/ fixtures
grep -rn "INTO display_permissions\|FROM display_permissions" --include=*.php .  # only lib/grants.php, plus tools/
grep -rn "WHERE id = 1\|id=1" --include=*.php . # must be empty
grep -rn "1920\|1080" --include=*.php .        # only prose, presets and help.php (Phase 6)
```

`php -l` cannot see inline JavaScript, and `builder.php` is ~2450 lines of it.
Anything touching that file needs reading, not linting.

On a server with a **copy** of live data — never the live database:

```
php tools/rehearse_phase1.php            # converge schema, prove scoping, publish twice
```

Then in a real browser: sign in → edit → publish → the Screen updates within
30s; publish again from a second stale tab → refused with a named holder;
`api.php?action=get_layout` with no session still returns the drive-thru layout.

Phases 4–5 additionally need two accounts (one admin, one `basic` with a single
grant) and, for the lock, two browsers. Phase 2 needs a genuinely
different-shaped Display, including a portrait one.

---

## 6. Delivery

One PR per phase, on `claude/app-update-planning-1pjqfr`, restarted from `main`
after each merge. Every merge reaches the sign by hand, so phase order is
deployment order and each phase must leave the app coherent on its own.
